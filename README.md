# Object-Recognition
Ultimate detection and recognition of predefined objects in real time.

************************************

A set of objects is **identified** and **recognized** whenever it comes to the frame. The detected object is marked within a rectangle with label specifying what object it is.

Objects recognized:
1. Face
2. Eye
3. Smile
4. Numberplate
5. Wallclock

******
1. Keep video.py and common.py files in the **same** folder as ObjectRecognition.py.
2. Make sure to **download haar folder** which contains all the haar-cascade files required for object recognition.
3. Also make sure that you **give the path correctly for the cascade files in args.get function within ObjectRecognition.py** - Change the path (provided) and make it correspond to the path for the haar-cascade files on your computer. 
4. **Run** ObjectRecognition.py - This opens your webcam and the objects (specified above) are recognized.
